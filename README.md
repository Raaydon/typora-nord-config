### How to install this theme:

- Open the themes folder (as explained under [the theme installation instructions](https://theme.typora.io/doc/Install-Theme/)) and move `nord.css` as well as the `nord` folder into it (the latter includes the 'missing' WOFF2 fonts). You can ignore all other files and folders.
